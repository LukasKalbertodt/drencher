//! Exact Solver
//!
//! This solver always finds an optimal solution (with as few moves as
//! possible). Currently, this solver is very slow and can't really handle
//! instances of size 8 and above.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! The idea is simple: the solver traverses the whole game tree in order to
//! find a solution. Traversing is done with breadth-first-search which means
//! that the first solution we find is optimal. The theoretical game tree has
//! 'm^c' nodes, where 'm' is the number of moves of one optimal solution and
//! 'c' is the number of colors. One can easily imagine that trees of bigger
//! instances are impossible to search through. Therefore we have to implement
//! some techniques to avoid searching the *whole* tree.
//!
//! Currently only one optimization is used: when branching deeper into the
//! tree, we ensure that the color of the move corresponding to the current
//! branch, is even a neighbor of the field of cells. If not, the move is
//! useless and the subtree can be ignored. Obviously.
//!
//! ## Representing the tree
//!
//! Right now, the tree is not really represented as a tree. Since we're
//! progressing the tree in BFS, we only need to save the last/current layer.
//! Each node in this layer is saved as a `State` which saves a board state and
//! all moves leading to this state.
//!
//!
//!
